# FastApiProject

Here is a brief description of files used in the project-

1) Config.py- Contains our global parameters like file name,flag list,etc. which are frequently used in our project.
2) Helper.py - Contains a series of helper functions needed to implement this project.
3) App2.py - Contains the web services which will be implemented on the server.
4) expanses.csv - This is our raw dataset

This project is implemented in python.  You need a version >=3.7 to be successfully deploy and test this.
The following external libraries will be required-

1) FastAPI- The REST endpoints are exposed using FastAPI library.
2) Uvicorn- Uvicorn is an ASGI web server implementation for Python. This will be required to host our web services in order to run it on the local machine.

Once the codes and the data is ready, simply App2.py needs to be run.

The APIs can be validated using any suitable too like Postman.
